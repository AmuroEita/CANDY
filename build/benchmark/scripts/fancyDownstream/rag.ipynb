One of the few things the P-47 is terrible at doing is prolonged dogfighting. Imagine a truck loaded with cement with wings strapped to the side. Congratulations, you just pictured a P-47 flying at low speeds. Now, with this out of the way you must remember one thing and one thing only, when and where possible, fly high, the higher the better. The higher in altitude the P-47 goes the better the engine performs compared to its potential adversaries. The best altitude for the P-47M is around 9,000 m (~30,000 ft), but it still can perform very good at lower altitudes ranging from 6,000 m (~20,000 ft) to 8,000 m (~26,000 ft). One drawback of the P-47M's engine is that it can easily overheat when using WEP for extended periods of time. However just disabling WEP for few seconds should be enough to cool down the powerful Pratt & Whitney powerplant hidden under the hood. More experienced pilots can utilize Manual Engine Controls (MEC) to eliminate overheating entirely. \n",

      "Usage of Fw_190_A-8_(USA):  The Fw 190 A-8 possesses far below average speed, acceleration, and climb ability for its rank. It does, however, have great high-speed control and a wicked armament that will shred any fighter almost instantly. It is recommended that you climb to the side and let your teammates engage first so you can put your excellent BnZ ability to work. If you spot a bandit co-alt, a head-on attack followed by an evasive manoeuvre and then extending away to repeat the processes is a recommended tactic. If a bandit has superior energy and is pressing an attack against you, try to drag them to friendlies, but don't sacrifice too much energy to do so. If you are skilled enough, another tactic would be to initiate a scissors; either rolling or flat, and then break away when he goes to yo-yo to control his overshoot. The scissors is a highly effective manoeuvre in the 190 A-8. If you are ballsy enough to press for a gun solution when scissoring an enemy, you could be greatly rewarded. In summary, climb to the side, Boom & Zoom like a champ, never get in a sustained turn fight, and use your rate of roll to free yourself when cornered. \n",

      "Usage of Spitfire_LF_Mk_IXc_(USA):  All Spitfire versions served primarily as fighter aircraft. Due to its high manoeuvrability, the Spitfire LF Mk IXc excels in dogfighting, matched only by a few opponents (mainly Japanese). Due to its vulnerabilities, namely its low ammunition load and somewhat flimsy airframe, it is not recommended to attack bombers with heavy defensive armament. Its climb rate is one of the Spitfire's greatest advantages, being able to outclimb many rivals at its rank. Despite this, it is not recommended to try to catch up with zoom-climbing enemy fighters, because the Spitfire will most likely run out of speed before you manage to engage the opponent. Therefore, go into a shallow but high-speed climb to patiently gain the same altitude as the foe. Do not waste too much speed or altitude to the Boom & Zoom bounce from above, or else it will not work. In emergency situations, when an opponent is diving onto you, your speed is insufficient to face them and, when there are no clouds to hide in, you can descend to the tree-top level and use sharp turns and preferably uneven terrain to make dive attacks impossible for your opponent. He will most likely have to pull up before he can attack, due to his high speed. Exactly at that moment when he is pulling up, you can take initiative. \n",

You can then use your engine power and energy retention to gain an energy advantage over them and easily kill them. If you find yourself in a tough situation, don't be afraid to go a bit aggressive because this plane accelerates very well at low altitude and the extremely powerful guns makes it easy to secure kills quickly, but don't stall yourself out at the deck amidst a cloud of enemies since you'll be an easy kill. \n",

Due to this, this is an amazing plane for dogfights, which you should always engage in. You should be cruising at ~3km, a perfect altitude to dive on any ground huggers or to dive away from any climbers who might swoop down upon you. Any dogfight you wish to initiate should be prioritized energy-wise; you should master the use of your flaps, they will give that needed edge. Keep fights low. In the circumstance you are below another propeller plane, you should extend the other direction and increase your IAS. Climbers like Bf 109 K-4, Ta-152 H, G.56, and so on, will not peruse you.

The climb rate allows it to get above everything enemy fighters or in the worst scenario at the same altitude, but then its armament can be used to push down the enemy fighters and force them to run or go for the head on attack, which in most cases the F7F will win, all its guns are place close to each other near the center of the plane, the gun convergence issues do not affect this plane and it possible to aim accurately even at the long distance, before the enemy gets close, a very high bullet velocity of shells for the guns also is helping a lot. After getting above the enemy the F7F can get very deadly because of its acceleration and energy retention, in most cases it will need only one approach to take out the enemy plane and trying to follow it in zoom climb can be an issue. When the F7F is below the enemy it can get hard, low turn and roll rate and also the fact that the plane is a large target will not help when the player is trying to avoid enemy attacks, although the superior dive acceleration and speed can be used to get away and then force the enemy to commit a head on attack. Dogfighting against any type of plane should be always avoided, an encounter at low speed will always end up very badly for the F7F because of its lacking manoeuvrability. \n",

      "Usage of F-80C-10:  Like most American fighters, your best option to attack is Boom and Zoom. At the start of the match, fly out towards the edge of the map. Climb at 2-3 degrees until you have reached ~770 km/h (~420 knots) at ~910 metres (~3,000 ft), then zoom climb at 20-30 degrees. Once you have slowed down to 287 km/h (155 kt), continue to climb at a solid 10 degrees. Optimally, you should have between 3.7-4.9 km (12,000-16,000 ft) depending on how high the highest enemy is, before turning towards the area of conflict (continue to climb or maintain altitude). Only once you have selected a target should you dive and make your pass. Always keep your energy high, whether it be speed or altitude. Because the F-80 is frequently uptiered, the best option is to dive on unsuspecting targets that are occupied engaging your teammates. \n",

Dive, engage, zoom up smoothly (to not lose a lot of speed) then rinse and repeat. If there are multiple enemies above you, don't engage and keep flying straight. If there is one enemy above you in the vicinity, you can engage, but don't pull up hard or you will lose a lot of speed in the process! Do it smoothly.

      "Usage of F-86F-25:  The F-86 F-25 differs greatly from its A-5 predecessor as it no longer has leading edge slats on the wings which increase low speed manoeuvrability. This was removed from the F model Sabres as North American Aviation (the maker of the Sabre) saw that low speed dogfights were a rare occasion (although a slatted wing made a comeback in the -40 block). A more powerful engine was also installed inside the F-86 giving it a better rate of climb, acceleration and top speed. In the F model the biggest difference between was the addition of the \"all flying tail\" which allowed for high speed manoeuvring. Where the Sabre excels is in high-speed manoeuvring. Its main opponent—the MiG-15bis—doesn't have an 'all flying tail,' so its control surfaces lock up at speeds exceeding 800 km/h (500 mph). Inexperienced pilots new to the aircraft must be careful of the Sabre's manoeuvrability, as it's quite easy to pull too many Gs and tear off the wings. Once the new engine is installed, the Sabre gets a much-improved rate of climb. Although not quite capable of out-climbing the MiG-15bis, the Sabre can handily out-climb (and out-dive) the MiG-15. \n",

It can be used as a boom-and-zoom fighter, perhaps after first dropping ordnance, as its powerful engine provides good energy retention. Air spawn in Realistic Air battles provides the somewhat necessary advantage for this. Its guns will be familiar from other F-84 and F-86 models, and are reasonably effective if aimed properly.

Try to climb up before engaging the enemy to ensure you have enough energy to get out of a sticky situation. Hopefully, there will be a chaotic fight underneath you where you would be able to pounce on low-energy fighters with your guns. One advantage the F-86 has over the jets of other nations is the large ammo count of its 6 x 50 cals (1,800) although it would be wise to hit most of your shots.

It is highly recommended not to dogfight in the F-104 as you aren't out-turning anything, and even if you have someone energy trapped, it is hard to capitalize on it as the F-104's manoeuvrability is just so poor. Additionally, if someone gets on your tail, there isn't much you can do. While the F-104 does have a good roll rate, the turning capability makes it so it cannot effectively perform defensive manoeuvres.

Quite often, opponents will have four of those advantages at once, meaning that F3H-2 pilots will have to resort to catching enemies off guard (a rarity due to the prevalence of radar and RWR systems at this BR) or get lucky in the classic head-on with your cannons. You can attempt to play as a CAS aircraft and hope you aren't shot down, but this can yield varying results due to its mediocre ground armament. If you choose to not outright purchase the AIM-7s with Golden Eagles, this should be the modification you focus on obtaining the moment you acquire the aircraft. In the event you find yourself on the defensive in a dogfight, the most you can do is slow down and constantly manoeuvre on the deck, hoping to get them in front of you and to help defeat AAMs. Note that this strategy is almost always suicide against VTOL aircraft like the Yak-38 or Harrier variants (as they will easily out manoevre you if they haven't already fired their AAMs). \n",

      "Usage of A-10A:  The A-10A is extremely effective in ground battles as long as it is used the right way. There are two methods for ground attack, and the tactic used is dictated by the type of threats on the ground. A low-risk situation is when there are no enemy SPAAs or fighters. When performing an attack run, start at a higher altitude, drop ordnance and fire the Avenger then escape for another attack run. In a high-risk environment, where there are enemy SPAAs, stay low and (relatively) fast. This allows pilots to stay below SPAA radar and lines of fire. When attacking, use intel from friendly ground forces to make precision strikes, then retreat after a single pass. After one pass, enemy SPAAs will know that there is an A-10, and be more alert. When trying to escape enemy fire after an attack run, preemptively dump chaff and flares in groups of at least four, and bank hard left and right until out of immediate range. AGM-65B Maverick AGMs are effective from up to 8 km, but from that distance any locked enemy has time to move behind cover before the missile impacts. When firing Mavericks, attempt to target enemy SPAAs that have not left spawn before targeting enemy MBTs. You can then use the ballistic computer for the GAU-8 and fire at any ground target. Because of the GAU-8's high penetration and extremely high rate of fire, the rounds will manage to go through any tank, even the heaviest armoured MBTs. Remember that even though the A-10 is a ground attack fighter, it is still equipped with AIM-9L AAMs. The A-10 has a good turn rate so, if attacked, swing around and fire a missile. However, you do not want any enemy aircraft to get the first shot on you, so keep an eye out for enemy aircraft. \n",

      "Usage of F4D-1:  Players who fly the A-4 series will feel familiar, since Douglas adopted a similar design of delta wing and autocannon on the F4D-1. Other traits are very similar as well, particularly the manoeuvrability and ballistics. While it has 2 pairs of guns on its wings, a concentrated burst on an enemy will certainly be their demise. Its overall high manoeuvrability and angle of attack (AoA) also helps to gain a slightly longer window to take out enemy aircraft, so long as you stay aware of your speed and keep turns below 950km/h, as this plane does lock up vertically in speeds greater than about 950 km/h. Beware of being stalled by manoeuvres: although the F4D can gain its speed back relatively quickly, this can leave enough window for enemies to lay their guns on your plane. So either be quick with taking down your target or evacuate from the battlefield for another attack run. Fuel is limited to 25 minutes, which goes fast when on full afterburner, so keep an eye on it. \n",

      "Usage of FJ-4B_VMF-232:  In battle, you are a support aircraft or a ground attack aircraft.  When being a support aircraft, your job is to bait the enemy into getting low and slow, which makes it easier for your allies to come and clean up the enemy.  Since you don't retain energy very well and you have poor acceleration, try to always manoeuvre with the enemy and if possible, shoot down enemy aircraft.  When using it as a ground attack aircraft you have many options.  The recommended loadout is 114 FFAR Mighty Mouse Rockets.  It is recommended that you attack primary ground targets like pillboxes and artillery positions.  It is not recommended to carry bombs on this aircraft as you do not have the bomb load to take out an enemy base.  Try to fly as low as possible to avoid being detected by the enemy.  If attacked by enemy aircraft, turn into your opponent as this will not give them a firing solution.  In Ground RB, you are one of the most heavily armed ground attackers for its tier, although in this game mode enemy tanks will require more than one rocket in order to be knocked out. \n",

      "Usage of F11F-1:  This plane is an extremely potent support fighter. It is one of the fastest aircraft at its battle rating, which will be your greatest advantage over other fighters. If you are in a full down-tier, no one will be able to catch you if you play it right. In low altitude level flight, the F11 can sustain speeds near (but not quite) Mach 1. Mach 1 cannot be achieved in low altitude level flight (unless at low fuel), but putting the plane in even a small dive at low altitude allows you to go supersonic. Actually passing Mach 1 doesn't give you much of an advantage as you are already faster than many planes you will face. In up-tiers where faster supersonics such as the MiG-19 and early MiG-21 variants can be found, the F11's speed isn't as potent, but if you keep your speed up you will find yourself able to keep up with these faster and more manoeuvrable aircraft. It's worth noting that the F11 compresses substantially near Mach, so if an early air-to-air missile is launched at you at this time, you will need to decide whether to manoeuvre to avoid it, or pitch up to drain it of its likely low energy. \n",

If desired, three externally-mounted gunpods may be equipped, but note that these may not be useful in certain situations. Although they will undoubtedly increase the vehicle's destructive capabilities, they also appreciably hinder flight performance through induced drag. In many situations, one front-facing cannon is all that is required to dispatch an opponent aircraft. As for the missiles, the ones used by this plane are average at its rank, comparable to the R-60 missiles equipped by the MiG-21MF (Germany) and the MiG-21SMT (albeit with worse manoeuvrability). The AIM-9J missiles are most effective when fired from between 1 to 3 km away from the target. Any closer and they will struggle to track and likely veer off target for a miss. \n",

Once you've made it to the side, look at your surroundings and determine which group of targets/bombing base will net you the most rewards with as little risk of being shot down as possible.

      "Usage of F-5C:  In air RB, the F-5C can be played as both a support and offensive plane. In medium range engagements, it plays well as a support fighter, either baiting enemies to use up missiles with the large amount of flares/chaff or launching missiles at enemies who are chasing friendly aircraft to give a chance to let your teammate get in a better position. In close range engagements, with some effort you can stay on the tail of the enemy, if possible making the enemy pull as many manoeuvres as possible to slow them down so you can get a short burst from the respectable 20 mm cannons mounted in the nose. Due to the plane's characteristics, overshooting an enemy won't be the end of a dogfight, the F-5C is able bleed enough speed in a quick turn to get right back on the enemy if they don't take advantage of the overshoot or if they are going too slow to be able to make any quick counterattack. Being slow and at a disadvantage, which is bad for any other jet at this tier, is especially terrible for this plane. The weak engines compared to its adversaries and the wing shape combine to give you great AoA but poor energy retention. At speeds above Mach 0.9, this is not an issue, but any lower than 850 km/h you will start to lose speed rapidly in a sharp turn. It is therefore recommended to pick 1v1 fights against weaker aircraft or enlist the help of teammates to take down the enemy. Another useful tip when grinding with the F-5C is to take an 2000 lb bomb and 2 BLU-1 incendiary bombs to drop on one base before turning around and going back for air targets on the way back to the base. \n",

When flying into the aforementioned engagement zone, pick out single fights or distracted enemies. The AIM-9E is not a reliable weapon and is easy to dodge, so try not to take missile shots from the sides or at a heavily manoeuvring opponent. When the opportunity to dogfight arises, take it only when you're sure other enemies are either distanced or far enough away from your position to not interrupt your fight and pick you off. When in a dogfight, you are almost always superior in manoeuvrability when compared to your opponent. MiG-21s or the J35s will be better in the first turn, but they bleed a lot of speed due to their delta wing design. Avoid their guns in the first turn, and use yours to take them out. While you have only 2 guns, they have a high muzzle velocity, making them easy to aim. The only downside with the cannons is their damage potential: you need to put several rounds on a target to destroy it. \n",

Bases are an option, but its low top speed combined with the limited manoeuvrability while carrying ordinance make it a perilous mission, as you are an easy target for any fighter that can show up, and friendly planes will almost always get there before you do. Flying to the side low to the ground is recommended, until enemy aircraft will back out or start fighting with your team. Then you can target respawning bases behind the frontline, and once you are done, if you didn't get a chance to do so, you can try to use your missiles to take down enemies, but keep in mind you don't want to start actively fighting. If a fighter decides to target you, strongly consider dropping your ordinance and abandoning any bombing run to increase your chances of survival. The strongest enemies you can encounter are the MiG-29, F-16 and F-14. There is nothing the A-7K can realistically do to counter those aircraft, so you want to stay unseen as long as it is possible, though the AIM-9L can occasionally get rid of an unsuspecting target. \n",
